## Overview

MSQ Market is a blockchain-powered admin dashboard built to manage an extensive digital ecosystem of users, coins, platforms, and financial tools. Designed for granular role-based access and seamless modularity, the platform empowers stakeholders—from admins to token issuers—to control and monitor operations such as QR payments, token distribution, P2P transactions, and super save vault systems in real time.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Role Dashboard Access**: Fine-grained role-based control enables users like platform admins, token managers, and education leads to access tailored dashboards and workflows.
- **Dynamic Sidebar with Permission-Aware Routing**: Sidebar items adapt to the user’s role and permissions, improving navigation and experience.
- **QR Payments and Token Management**: Secure and scalable QR-based transactions, token creation, tracking, and detail views.
- **P2P & P2U Trading Modules**: Full modules to manage peer-to-peer and peer-to-user trades, including RPA histories, blockchain transactions, and error logs.
- **Super Save Vault System**: Advanced financial operations like deposit/withdrawals, cash transfers, bug reports, bank fees, and time-based notification settings.
- **Education & Inquiry Tools**: Tools for educational content management, inquiries, news distribution, and popup notifications.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For creating a performant, server-rendered React-based frontend.
- **TypeScript**: Ensuring strong typing across components and data flows.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive, modern UI using utility-first CSS.
- **Node.js**: Backend API layer for authentication, data management, and service logic.
- **MongoDB & PostgreSQL**: Hybrid database design for flexible storage of hierarchical and relational data models.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Smart contract-driven systems for coin and transaction validation.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Fine-tuned access per user role ensures maximum security and modular control.

## Challenges and Learnings

Designing a unified interface for such a wide range of administrative modules required balancing complexity and clarity. Each role demanded custom views, logic branching, and security enforcement. We tackled this by defining a `MenuItem` schema and linking it dynamically with permissions. Handling deeply nested routing and conditional sidebars also helped improve UX without compromising on scalability.

## Outcome

The MSQ Market admin dashboard provides real-time visibility and operational control across a complex blockchain-based platform. It supports decentralized decision-making and seamless user operations, helping improve security, accountability, and efficiency for digital finance administrators and token platform managers.
